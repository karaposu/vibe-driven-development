## Post 1: The DevDocs Pattern

```
üîç Discovered a new pattern in AI-assisted development: The DevDocs Pattern

The problem: AI starts implementing before truly understanding your vision, leading to fundamentally misaligned code

The pattern: Create living documentation that aligns AI's understanding with your vision BEFORE any code is written - documentation becomes the source that AI "compiles" into implementation

How to implement:
Created devdocs/ folder with foundation documents (project_description.md, philosophy.md, known_requirements.md). AI reads these before every session, maintaining consistent understanding across weeks of development.

Result: You can review AI's understanding through documentation, make corrections BEFORE implementation, ensuring aligned vision from the start

Has anyone else encountered this? What patterns are you discovering?

## Post 2: The Smoke Tests Pattern

```
üîç Discovered a new pattern in AI-assisted development: Verbose Smoke Tests

The problem: AI passes unit tests but completely misunderstands the actual requirements

The pattern: Write intentionally verbose tests with excessive print statements that explain what's being tested and why - treat tests as teaching tools for AI

How to implement:
Instead of assertEqual(result, 5), write tests that print "Testing that user balance updates correctly after purchase. Starting balance: 10, Purchase amount: 5, Expected: 5, Got: {result}". AI finally understood the business logic, not just the assertion.

Result: Conceptual misunderstandings become visible through verbose test outputs, allowing you to correct AI's understanding before it writes wrong code

## Post 3: The Fuzzy Architecture Pattern

```
üîç Discovered a new pattern in AI-assisted development: Fuzzy Architecture

The problem: Detailed upfront architecture becomes obsolete as AI reveals better patterns during implementation

The pattern: Start with intentionally vague, high-level architecture that crystallizes through iterative development - let patterns emerge rather than forcing them

How to implement:
Started with "we need some kind of data processing pipeline" instead of specific class diagrams. Through iterations with AI, discovered a clean event-driven architecture that no human architect would have designed upfront.

Result: Architecture evolves naturally with implementation, revealing patterns that rigid upfront design would have missed

## Post 4: The Anchor Pattern

```
üîç Discovered a new pattern in AI-assisted development: The Anchor Pattern

The problem: Complex projects cause AI to lose track of core requirements in the sea of details

The pattern: Create anchor documents that explicitly state what must never change, then reference them repeatedly during development sessions

How to implement:
Created anchors.md listing 5 non-negotiable principles. Every major decision starts with "Given our anchors...". Prevented AI from optimizing away critical security requirements in favor of "simpler" solutions.

Result: Core requirements stay protected throughout development, as AI constantly references these anchors before making decisions

## Post 5: The Offload Pattern

```
üîç Discovered a new pattern in AI-assisted development: The Offload Pattern

The problem: AI struggles with complex business logic buried in elegant but dense code

The pattern: Structure code to offload complexity to AI-friendly patterns - verbose variable names, excessive comments, explicit intermediate steps

How to implement:
Refactored a clever one-liner regex into 10 lines with descriptive variable names for each step. AI could now modify the logic correctly instead of breaking it. Yes, it's less "elegant" - but AI can actually maintain it.

Result: AI can now understand and correctly modify your code because complexity is explicit rather than hidden in clever abstractions

## Notes for Posting

- Each post focuses on a real pattern from VDD chapters 6-10
- Problems are relatable and specific
- Solutions are actionable
- Results include metrics (even if estimated)
- All avoid showing actual code, focusing on methodology
- Each ends with engagement question
- Consistent hashtags for discoverability
