Welcome to VDD Community! 🚀

You're here because you know AI coding can be better than "prompt and pray."

This is where developers share what actually works:
✅ Real patterns from production
✅ Failures that taught us something
✅ Techniques that saved our sanity

Not theories. Not hype. Just developers figuring out how to engineer with AI.

Free book: https://karaposu.github.io/vibe-driven-development/

(It's a starting point, not gospel. Any logical, systematic, repeatable pattern can be VDD)

Introduce yourself and tell us about your biggest pain points about AI driven development
