## Content Calendar Suggestions

**Monday:** Quick Tips - Start the week with actionable advice
**Tuesday:** Case Studies - Deep dive into real projects
**Wednesday:** Discussion Starters - Mid-week engagement
**Thursday:** Pattern Discovery - Share new findings
**Friday:** Before/After or Lessons Learned - End week with reflection

## Engagement Guidelines

1. **Always end with a question** to encourage discussion
2. **Include specific examples** rather than abstract concepts
3. **Share actual scenarios and examples** when relevant
4. **Link to book chapters** for deeper exploration
5. **Use metrics and data** to support claims
6. **Acknowledge when something doesn't work** - authenticity builds trust

## Hashtag Strategy

Primary: #VibeDrivenDevelopment #VDD
Secondary: #AIAssistedDevelopment #GenerativeAI #AIcoding
Context-specific: #DevOps #SoftwareEngineering #CodingPatterns #DeveloperProductivity

## Visual Content Ideas

- Screenshots of DevDocs structure
- Before/after workflow comparisons
- Flowcharts of VDD patterns
- Quick video demos of techniques
- Infographics of pattern relationships

Remember: The goal is to build a community of practitioners sharing real experiences, not promoting theory without practice.
