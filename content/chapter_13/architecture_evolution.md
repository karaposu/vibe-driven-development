# Chapter 13: Architecture Evolution

## From Fuzzy to Focused

Architecture in vibe coding isn't designed upfront - it evolves. You start intentionally vague and let the right structure emerge through implementation. This chapter covers the journey from initial sketch to refined architecture.

## Creating the Initial Architecture

### Starting Fuzzy

After establishing DevDocs, create your first architecture:

```
Please propose the most suitable architecture for this project. Keep in mind:
- We'll develop iteratively, evolving from simple prototype to complex versions
- Avoid over-engineering or excessive complexity at this stage  
- The architecture will evolve as we progress, maintain flexibility
- Focus on high-level concepts that accommodate core requirements
- Balance simplicity with extensibility
- Use proper design patterns where appropriate (e.g., repository pattern)

Save your proposal as architecture.md
```

### What Makes Architecture "Fuzzy"

Good initial architecture specifies boundaries, not implementations:

```markdown
# Architecture Overview

## High-Level Structure

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   UI Layer      │  (User interactions)
├─────────────────┤
│ Business Logic  │  (Core rules)
├─────────────────┤
│  Data Layer     │  (Persistence)
└─────────────────┘
```

## Component Responsibilities

**UI Layer**
- Present information to users
- Capture user input
- Handle user interactions

**Business Logic**
- Process expense data
- Calculate summaries
- Enforce business rules
- Handle currency conversion

**Data Layer**  
- Store and retrieve data
- Ensure data integrity
- Handle import/export

## Decisions Deferred
- Specific UI framework (React vs Vue)
- Storage mechanism (localStorage vs IndexedDB)
- State management approach
- Build tooling
```

### Why This Works

1. **Clear boundaries** without implementation details
2. **Responsibilities** defined without how
3. **Flexibility** to discover best approaches
4. **No premature** optimization or complexity

## The Architecture Critique

### Compatibility Check

Don't accept the first architecture blindly:

```
Review architecture.md and perform a comprehensive compatibility check against 
all project data and requirements.

Check:
1. Does every requirement have a home in the architecture?
2. Are there architectural components without requirements?
3. Do the boundaries make sense for our constraints?
4. Is this simple enough for our timeline?

If you identify issues, update architecture.md.

Additionally, create requirements_and_architecture.md that maps each 
requirement to its architectural component.
```

### Requirements Mapping

Example requirements_and_architecture.md:

```markdown
# Requirements to Architecture Mapping

## Functional Requirements

### Offline Operation
- **Architectural Component**: Data Layer
- **Implementation**: Local storage mechanism
- **Interfaces**: Storage API that works offline

### Multi-Currency Support  
- **Architectural Component**: Business Logic
- **Implementation**: Currency conversion service
- **Interfaces**: Currency API, Exchange rate storage

### Data Export
- **Architectural Component**: Data Layer + Business Logic
- **Implementation**: Export service using storage API
- **Interfaces**: Export formats, Data transformation

## Technical Requirements

### < 1 second page load
- **Architectural Component**: All layers
- **Implementation**: Minimal dependencies, lazy loading
- **Considerations**: Affects framework choice

### Mobile-first design
- **Architectural Component**: UI Layer
- **Implementation**: Responsive components
- **Considerations**: Touch interactions, small screens
```

## Defining Modules and Structure

### From Architecture to Modules

With architecture established, define concrete modules:

```
Based on the architecture, please generate:

1. A comprehensive list of core modules with:
   - Primary purpose and functionality
   - Core responsibilities
   - Integration points with other modules
   
2. A complete folder structure reflecting this modular organization

Ensure modules are properly decoupled for independent development and testing.
```

### Example Module Breakdown

```markdown
# Core Modules

## 1. Storage Module
**Purpose**: Handle all data persistence
**Responsibilities**:
- Save/load expense data
- Handle storage limits
- Data versioning/migration
**Integration Points**:
- Provides data to Display module
- Receives data from Input module

## 2. Currency Module  
**Purpose**: Multi-currency support
**Responsibilities**:
- Convert between currencies
- Store exchange rates
- Format currency display
**Integration Points**:
- Used by Input for entry
- Used by Display for viewing
- Used by Export for reports

## 3. Export Module
**Purpose**: Data export for taxes
**Responsibilities**:
- Generate CSV files
- Filter by date range
- Format for tax software
**Integration Points**:
- Reads from Storage
- Uses Currency for conversion
```

### Folder Structure

## Architecture Evolution Through Implementation

### Natural Pattern Discovery

As you implement modules, patterns emerge:

```
"I've noticed we're repeating error handling logic. 
Should we extract a common error handling pattern?"
```

This leads to architectural evolution:

```markdown
# Architecture Overview (Updated)

## New Patterns Discovered

### Error Handling Layer
- Consistent error types
- User-friendly messages  
- Error logging service
- Recovery strategies

### Event System
- Loose coupling between modules
- Enable future features
- Better testability
```

### The Gradual Solidification

Week 1: Everything is fuzzy
```markdown
## Data Storage
Some kind of local storage solution
```

Week 3: Patterns emerge
```markdown
## Data Storage
- localStorage for user preferences
- JSON serialization for expense data
- Simple key-value structure
```

Week 6: Architecture solidifies
```markdown
## Data Storage
- Repository pattern with StorageRepository
- localStorage with 5MB limit handling
- Migrations via version field
- Abstracted for future IndexedDB upgrade
```

## Architectural Decision Records

### Documenting Evolution

Track why architecture evolved:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Repository Pattern for Storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Storage module was getting complex with direct localStorage calls scattered throughout.

## Decision
Implement Repository pattern to centralize storage logic.

## Consequences
- ✅ Single place for storage logic
- ✅ Easier to test
- ✅ Can swap storage mechanism  
- ❌ Additional abstraction layer
- ❌ More code initially
```

### Pattern Evolution

Document pattern discoveries:

```markdown
# Pattern: Module Communication via Events

## Discovered
Week 4 during currency module integration

## Problem
Direct module dependencies creating tight coupling

## Solution
Event-based communication:
- Modules publish events
- Other modules subscribe
- No direct dependencies

## Example
Currency module publishes 'rates-updated'
Export module subscribes to refresh calculations
```

## Refactoring Checkpoints

### When to Refactor

With modules working and tests passing:

```
Now that we have working modules with passing smoke tests, let's evaluate 
our architecture holistically.

If you were to identify ONE core abstraction that would significantly 
improve code clarity and maintainability, what would it be?

Consider:
- Current code duplication
- Complexity points that could be simplified  
- Opportunities for better separation of concerns

Save your proposal in architecture_improvement.md
```

### Implementing Architectural Improvements

If refactoring makes sense:

```
Review architecture.md and architecture_improvement.md, then:

1. Implement the proposed architectural improvements
2. Update all affected smoke tests
3. Run all tests until they pass
4. Update relevant documentation

This should result in cleaner, more maintainable code while 
preserving all existing functionality.
```

## Architecture Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Premature Complexity

❌ Starting with:
```
Microservices, event sourcing, CQRS, distributed cache
```

✅ Starting with:
```
Simple modules with clear boundaries
```

### 2. Over-Generic Architecture

❌ "This could work for any app"

✅ "This specifically fits our expense tracker requirements"

### 3. Technology-Driven Architecture

❌ "Let's use GraphQL because it's modern"

✅ "Let's use REST because it's simple and sufficient"

### 4. Big Bang Refactoring

❌ "Let's rewrite everything with the new pattern"

✅ "Let's refactor one module and see if it helps"

## Managing Architectural Drift

### Signs of Drift

- New features don't fit cleanly
- Lots of workarounds needed
- Performance degrading
- Tests becoming complex
- Modules too interdependent

### Course Correction

```
"Our architecture seems to be struggling with the new requirements.
Let's review:
1. What aspects are working well?
2. What aspects are causing friction?
3. What minimal changes would help?

Update architecture.md with findings."
```

## The Living Architecture

### Documentation Updates

Architecture.md should evolve:

```markdown
# Architecture Overview

## Version History
- v1.0 (Week 1): Initial fuzzy architecture
- v1.1 (Week 3): Added module boundaries
- v2.0 (Week 6): Introduced Repository pattern
- v2.1 (Week 8): Added event system

## Current State
[Updated architecture diagram]

## Future Considerations
- May need job queue for large exports
- Consider IndexedDB for > 5MB data
- Possible PWA enhancement
```

### Architecture Reviews

Regular checkpoints:

```
"It's been 2 weeks since our last architecture review.
Please analyze:
1. Is our architecture still serving us well?
2. What pain points have emerged?
3. What patterns have proven useful?
4. What should we consider changing?

Update architecture_review_[date].md"
```

## Success Metrics

Good architecture evolution shows:

1. **Modules remain independent** - Can develop/test separately
2. **New features fit naturally** - No major contortions
3. **Performance stays consistent** - No degradation
4. **Tests stay simple** - No complex mocking
5. **Developers stay happy** - Code is pleasant to work with

## The Meta-Pattern

Architecture evolution in vibe coding follows nature:
1. **Seed** (fuzzy start)
2. **Growth** (patterns emerge)  
3. **Pruning** (remove what doesn't work)
4. **Maturity** (stable, proven patterns)
5. **Adaptation** (evolve with new requirements)

Don't force it. Guide it. Let the right architecture reveal itself through building.
