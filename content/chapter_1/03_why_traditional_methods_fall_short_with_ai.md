# Why Traditional Methods Fall Short with AI

## The Fundamental Mismatch

Traditional methodologies assume human limitations:
- Developers write ~100 lines/day
- Context switching is expensive  
- Knowledge transfer takes time

AI breaks these assumptions:
- Generates thousands of lines/minute
- No context switching cost
- Instant "knowledge" of any framework

## Where Waterfall Breaks

**Problem 1: Upfront Design Becomes Guesswork**
- AI can prototype five architectures while you're writing requirements
- Detailed specs become prison bars, not guidelines
- By implementation phase, better patterns have emerged

**Problem 2: Phase Gates Block Learning**
- AI reveals design flaws immediately through code
- Waiting for "testing phase" wastes AI's rapid feedback
- Sequential phases ignore AI's iterative nature

## Where Agile Stumbles

**Problem 1: Sprint Velocity Becomes Meaningless**
- AI completes "8 story points" in 10 minutes
- Planning poker is absurd when AI codes at conversation speed
- Team velocity metrics don't capture AI amplification

**Problem 2: Ceremonies Become Bottlenecks**
- Daily standups slower than AI implementation
- Sprint reviews can't keep pace with AI output
- Retrospectives happen after AI has moved on

## The Core Issues

### 1. Trust vs Verification Gap
Traditional: Trust developers to write correct code
Reality: AI needs constant verification, not trust

### 2. Planning vs Discovery
Traditional: Plan then execute
Reality: AI enables discovery through execution

### 3. Documentation Timing  
Traditional: Document after stability
Reality: Documentation drives AI behavior

### 4. Error Philosophy
Traditional: Prevent errors through process
Reality: Fix errors faster than preventing them

## The New Reality

With AI, you're not managing code creation - you're managing code generation. This requires:
- Real-time steering, not upfront planning
- Continuous verification, not phase gates
- Living documentation, not post-facto specs

Traditional methods optimize for human constraints that no longer exist.
