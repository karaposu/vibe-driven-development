# AI Taming: Keeping Control While Leveraging Power

## The Director's Chair

In vibe coding, you're not a programmer anymore - you're a director. 

Traditional coding is like walking: you control every step, every muscle movement. AI-assisted coding should be like driving: you control direction and speed while the machine handles mechanics.

But there's a problem. Cars don't randomly drive to unexpected destinations. AI does.

## The Self-Driving Paradox

AI can literally code by itself. Give it a vague goal and it will build something. Maybe not what you wanted, but something functional.

This is both AI's greatest strength and biggest danger.

## Evolution of Intent

**Traditional Development:**
```
Human: "Build user authentication with email/password, bcrypt hashing, JWT tokens"
AI: *builds exactly that specification*
```

**Vibe Coding:**
```
Human: "Users need secure access to their personal data"
AI: *suggests OAuth, biometrics, passwordless, evaluates tradeoffs*
Human: "Let's go passwordless for better UX"
AI: *implements magic links with rate limiting*
```

You're not micromanaging implementation. You're directing intent and making strategic decisions.

## The Shifting Boundary

As AI evolves, the boundary shifts upward:

**You Focus On:**
- What problems need solving
- What success looks like  
- What constraints are non-negotiable
- Which tradeoffs to accept

**AI Handles:**
- How to implement solutions
- Which patterns fit best
- What optimizations to apply
- How to structure code

## Maintaining Control

The key insight: You must remain the director, not become a passenger.


## The New Core Skills

Traditional skills (syntax, algorithms) become secondary. Primary skills now:

**Intent Articulation**
- Express goals clearly
- Communicate context effectively
- Define success criteria

**Constraint Specification**
- Set boundaries explicitly
- Define non-negotiables
- Specify quality requirements

**Quality Recognition**
- Identify good solutions and overengineered ones quickly
- Spot potential issues
- Recognize when "good enough" is reached

**Vision Preservation**
- Maintain project coherence
- Prevent scope creep
- Keep long-term goals in focus
