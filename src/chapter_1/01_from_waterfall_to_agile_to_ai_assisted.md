# From Waterfall to Agile to AI-Assisted

## The Linear Era: Waterfall (1970s-1990s)

Waterfall dominated when software was simpler. Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment. Each phase completed before the next began. It worked because:
- Software scope was limited
- Teams were smaller
- Change was expensive

**The Breaking Point**: Internet boom. Software complexity exploded. Six-month requirement phases became obsolete before implementation started.

## The Iterative Revolution: Agile (2000s-2020s)

Agile flipped the script. Two-week sprints. Constant feedback. Embrace change. Key principles:
- Working software over documentation
- Customer collaboration over contracts
- Responding to change over plans

**Why It Worked**: Matched the pace of business. Developers could adapt quickly. Users saw progress regularly.

## The AI Transformation (2023s-Present)

AI assistants changed everything again. A developer + AI can now output what entire teams produced. But traditional methodologies break down:

**Waterfall + AI = Chaos**: AI needs constant steering. Six-month plans are meaningless when AI can prototype in hours.

**Agile + AI = Friction**: Sprint planning becomes bottleneck. AI works at near conversation speed, not sprint speed.

## Era of Vibe Coding

Vibe coding emerged from developers actually using AI. It's built on three realizations:

1. **AI amplifies both good and bad patterns** - Structure matters more than ever
2. **Documentation becomes executable** - What you write shapes what AI builds
3. **Testing is dialogue** - Tests become conversations where you show AI what "correct" means through examples

The shift: From managing people to managing intelligence. From writing all code to directing code generation. From preventing bugs to rapidly fixing them.
