before starting the implementation we should be more careful and increase understanding\
  \
  to increase our understanding on this manner, tell me what needs to be inspected througly and what confirmations we need
  reagrding the generic logc, providers, frameworks, code run result types, use cases. \
  \

  do this in devdocs/enhancements/__ enhancement_name __/gaps_to_fill/gap_list.md




 okay now for each item in gap list document, I would like you to find  resolvable ones via inspecting existing code and understand and resolve the questions (dont do implementation) 
 
 also dont forget to put your understanding/answers in relevant .md file  in 
 devdocs/enhancements/audiostreamingport/gaps_to_fill/answers/
 
 
  and if sth is not viable to resolve by looking at the code and needs some info regarding external dependency or data,file etc. put them in 

  devdocs/enhancements/__ enhancement_name __/gaps_to_fill/help_needed_gap_list.md
