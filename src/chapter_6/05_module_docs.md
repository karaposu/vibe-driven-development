## Module-Level Documentation

Modular development is hard requirement for vibe coding due to context length limitations of current AI models. 
And devdocs pattern also complies with this fact. Development is done in a modular and decoupled way. And there will be seperate submodules each being actively developed in parallel together with the project. And these modules are expected be able to integrate with each other.  

During the development a module can change. This change can be completely internal, interface level, architectural level or change in a way scalability or about requirements. And each change has a big chance to propagate. 

And all these changes should be reflected on other modules. Or they will break the code. This is philosophy behind the module docs. To keep up-to-date documentation for each module and update them as changes happen. Multi module Development is a parallel process where each change in either module might propagate  



under devdocs/modules dir we will create a module specifc folder (module_A) and have these docs 


### what_is_this_for.md

Core purpose document that explains the module's reason for existence.

- Primary problem this module solves
- Why it's a separate module (not part of another)
- What would break without this module
- Who/what depends on this module

Example:
```markdown
# Authentication Module Purpose

This module handles all user authentication and session management.

## Why Separate
- Security isolation - auth logic contained
- Reusability - multiple services need auth
- Specialized testing - security-focused tests

## Dependencies
- User service relies on this for identity
- API gateway uses this for request validation
- Admin panel requires this for permissions
```

### interfaces_and_endpoints.md

Defines all public interfaces, APIs, and methods other modules can use.

- Public functions/methods with signatures
- REST endpoints with request/response formats
- Event emissions and subscriptions
- Database tables accessed/modified

Example:
```markdown
# Auth Module Interfaces

## Public Methods
- `authenticate(username, password) => {token, user}`
- `validateToken(token) => {valid, user}`
- `refreshToken(token) => {newToken}`

## REST Endpoints
- POST /auth/login - {username, password} => {token}
- POST /auth/logout - {token} => {success}
- GET /auth/verify - Headers: {Authorization} => {valid}

## Events Emitted
- 'user.login' - {userId, timestamp}
- 'user.logout' - {userId, timestamp}
```

### integration_points.md

This doc explain how this module can be integrated. It is possible a module is developed in a flexible way and  there are multiple integration points approaches. This document explains them in a high level. 



### integration_requirements.md

When modules are integrated there might be middleware requirements which should be satisfied. 
This document explains such situations. 


### limitations.md

Current constraints and known boundaries.

- Performance limits (requests/second, data size)
- Feature boundaries (what it won't do)
- Technical constraints (browser compatibility, etc.)
- Security boundaries


Example:
```markdown
# Module Limitations

## Performance
- Max 1000 concurrent sessions
- Token validation adds 50ms latency
- Password hashing takes 200ms

## Features Not Supported
- Social login (OAuth)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric authentication

## Technical Constraints
- Requires Node 18+ for crypto features
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- No support for JWT key rotation yet
```

### possible_use_cases.md

Examples of how other modules might use this one.

- Recommended usage scenarios
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance considerations

Example:
```markdown
# Possible Use Cases

## Standard Login Flow
1. Gateway receives credentials
2. Calls authenticate() method
3. Stores token in cookie
4. Validates token on subsequent requests

## Service-to-Service Auth
1. Service requests service token
2. Uses token for API calls
3. Refreshes before expiry

## Avoid These Patterns
- Don't validate token on every database query
- Don't store tokens in localStorage (use httpOnly cookies)
- Don't skip token refresh logic
```

### edge_cases_covered.md


This doc talks about intentionally handled edge cases. Not includes generic error handling and keeps it minumum. 

### example_usage.md
This doc shows how this module can be used  (Common operations) with code examples. 


### summary.md

This doc is used when it is feasible AI to read all docs due to context limitations.  Summary shows Quick reference combining key points from all module docs.

- Max 3 sentence purpose. 
- Main interfaces list
- Critical limitations
- Quick integration checklist
