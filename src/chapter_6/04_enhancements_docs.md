## Enhancement Documentation

Enhancement docs capture future possibilities without cluttering current implementation. They're parking spaces for good ideas that aren't ready yet.

This is a freestyle documentation space. Which means there is not specific structure to it. 
 It usually includes 2 types of documents:

feature enhancements
architecture enhancements

## feature enhancements

lets say during development you understand a new feature optional debug output would be cool. But you need to structure your thoughts on 
this feature. you would first desc the fearure and then 

you would ask AI to answer these questions  
  
  What this feature is and how it works
  how this feature help project goals and requirements
  how this featrue would impact existing architecture 
  how codebase should be changed for this feature (in a high level)
 
 and create feat_debug.md  and then using this document and HILing you can ask ai to do the implementation


## Architectural enhancements

Architectural enhancements shouldnt be taking lightly. It is like Playing with fire and can break everything or entangle everything.  But if it is certain for future then you can have them 


### Why This Matters

Development reveals opportunities. Without a dedicated place to capture them, you either:
- Lose valuable insights
- Derail current work with scope creep
- Implement half-baked features

Enhancement docs let AI understand the project's growth trajectory. When you're ready to expand, AI already knows the roadmap.

### Best Practices

- Add enhancements as you discover them, not retrospectively
- Keep descriptions concrete enough to action later
- Link related enhancements that should be implemented together
- Review periodically and promote ready items to actual concepts
- Delete obsolete enhancements to prevent confusion

This systematic approach turns "wouldn't it be nice if..." moments into actionable future work.
