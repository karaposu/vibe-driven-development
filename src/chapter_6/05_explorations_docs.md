## Exploration Documentation

A freestyle workspace for capturing AI-generated insights and clarifications discovered during development.

### What Goes Here

Any investigation or explanation worth preserving:
- how_authentication_works.md
- why_not_use_microservices.md
- which_database_should_we_use.md
- performance_bottleneck_analysis.md

### Why It Matters

During development, you'll frequently ask AI to explain, investigate, or analyze aspects of your codebase. Some responses are too valuable to lose in conversation history. The explorations folder preserves these insights for future reference.

### Best Practices

- Name files as questions or topics for easy scanning
- Keep the original AI response if it was particularly clear
- Update when understanding evolves
- Link from main docs when relevant

This folder becomes your project's knowledge base - a living FAQ built from actual development questions.
