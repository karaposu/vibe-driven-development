# Root Documentation: The Foundation

## Why Foundation Documents Matter

Foundation documents are the bedrock of VDD. They capture your original vision in a structured format, establishing the core truths that guide every decision throughout the project. 

These three documents form a hierarchy of intent:
- **What** we're building (project_description.md)
- **Why** we're building it (philosophy.md)  
- **How** we must build it (known_requirements.md)

AI reads these first in every session. They become the lens through which AI interprets all subsequent project development.

## The Three Foundation Documents

### 1. project_description.md - The North Star

This document transforms scattered project information into structured understanding. It's the single source of truth about what you're building.

**Core Questions to Answer:**
- What are we building?
- What are the various scopes of this project?
- What problem are we solving?
- What does success look like?
- Who will use it and why?


### 2. philosophy.md - The Soul

Philosophy captures the intangible aspects that shape every decision. It's about values, not features. This document prevents technically correct but visionally/spiritually wrong implementations. 


**Core Question to Answer:**
- what is the philosophy of this project?



### 3. known_requirements.md - The Contract

Requirements translate vision into concrete constraints. They define the boundaries within which AI must operate.

**Core Questions to Answer:**
- What technical constraints exist?
- What business rules apply?
- What user needs must be met?
- What regulations must we follow?
