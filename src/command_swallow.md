I want you to read all coding files in this codebase and understand everything. 
Only output a very short summary. The point is to make you swallow the context thats all

- when you scan the codebase make sure read the code files fully 
- Understand that a code exists doesnt mean it def works 
- focus on creating a inner mapping of the codebase while keeping the details
