## Other Devdoc Files 

This is a freestyle documentation zone. Just like how software development cant be done in one particular way, how people  approach to the project or knowledge is the same.  So feel free to create different format of devdocs suiting your need. 

One example could be decisions.md to keep track of architectural decisions. 


### decisions.md


This document logs architectural decisions with their rationale.
It's crucial for anchoring development progress across sessions.
Sometimes we encounter bugs or edge cases that require hours of careful design to solve elegantly. The resulting solution might seem unnecessary when viewed without context. If AI examines this design later without understanding the original problem, it may mistakenly remove or break the delicate solution we crafted.


Each entry in this document explains 
    - what is current bottleneck/issue
    - what are the options considered
    - what option is selected and why
    - Explain in a high level what consequences this change might cause
