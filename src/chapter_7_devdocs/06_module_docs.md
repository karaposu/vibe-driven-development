## Module Documentation

Software development thrives on modularity. During active development, multiple submodules evolve in parallel, each maintaining its own lifecycle while integrating with the whole.

This approach adds overhead but delivers significant benefits: truly decoupled components, isolated testing, and clear expansion paths for future enhancements.

For vibe coding, modularity isn't optional - it's essential. AI's context limitations demand it, clean code principles require it, and testability depends on it. 

And during this paralel development we encounter 2 problems
    - acting as a human in the loop (HILing ) is harder than usual
    - module's code is spread across multiple code files therefore keeping them in context is harder for ai, which result in errors

Module documentation solves these 2 problems. 

Modules constantly evolve through internal refactoring, interface updates, and architectural shifts. Without synchronized  documentation, these changes cascade unpredictably, breaking integrations across the system. Module docs serve as living contracts between components, ensuring changes propagate cleanly.


### Structure: devdocs/modules/[module_name]/

Each module folder contains these standardized documents:

### what_is_this_for.md

Explains the module's core purpose and reason for existence:
- Primary problem it solves
- Why it's a separate module
- What breaks without it
- Who depends on it

### interfaces_and_endpoints.md

Defines all public interfaces other modules can use:
- Public methods with signatures
- REST/GraphQL endpoints
- Event emissions and subscriptions
- Database tables accessed

### integration_points.md

Describes how to integrate this module:
- Connection methods
- Configuration options
- Alternative integration patterns
- Setup requirements

### integration_requirements.md

Lists prerequisites for integration:
- Required middleware
- Environment variables
- External dependencies
- Permission requirements

### limitations.md

Documents current constraints:
- Performance limits (requests/second, data size)
- Feature boundaries (what it explicitly won't do)
- Technical constraints (compatibility, versions)
- Known issues

### possible_use_cases.md

Provides integration examples:
- Recommended usage patterns
- Common scenarios
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance tips

### edge_cases_covered.md

Lists intentionally handled edge cases:
- Boundary conditions addressed
- Error scenarios managed
- Race conditions prevented

### example_usage.md

Shows concrete code examples:
- Common operations
- Initialization patterns
- Error handling
- Testing approaches

### summary.md

Quick reference when full docs exceed context:
- Three-sentence purpose
- Main interfaces list
- Critical limitations
- Integration checklist
