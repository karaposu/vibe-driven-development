ultrathink about how would you implement this feature/approach [we dont care about legacy support!]

then create an implementation plan  in devdocs/enhancements/_suitable_name_here_/high_level.md 

1. High level summary of what is being trying to do
2. Again High level bullet points steps of the implementation plan 
3. Explanaition of Current beheaviour vs Expected New Behaviour in multiple aspects/angles elobarated
4. Edge cases that should be considered. 



and once this is finished again ultrathink about 

low level implementation 

then create an implementation plan  in devdocs/enhancements/_suitable_same_name_here_/low_level.md 

- make sure dont assume any code, go and look it up and inspect
- low level doesnt mean full code but code snippets with eexplanations of 

        1. what changes
        2. why change is needed
