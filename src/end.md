This was an interesting write for me. I also extensively used AI to process and refine some thoughts. I knew something by intuition and did not really understood why. And I did not know that I did not understood them as well. I guess one of the greatest benefits of AI is that humanity will be finally understand themselves. Regardless of it dooms us or not AI is cool and building with AI feels like magic.
