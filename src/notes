Hofstadter’s Law:

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.

-----------
Alistair Cockburn defined the Walking Skeleton practice as:

a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components. The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel.







Decision Extraction Pattern" or "Policy Isolation Pattern" where:

  1. Complex conditional logic is extracted into named predicate methods
  2. Business rules are separated from execution logic
  3. Decision points become extension points for future changes
  4. Intent is made explicit through method naming





  **Pattern**: Composition through delegation
Favor composition for flexibility and testing

 Simple defaults with optional complexity
 **Philosophy**: Make simple things easy, complex  things possible


 Service Abstraction
**Decision**: Hide external service complexity


Validate Early
**Pattern**: Check requirements at initialization


 Incremental Enhancement
 Philosophy**: Evolution, not revolution
