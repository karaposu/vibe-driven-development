# VIBE CODING A NEW PROJECT 

This appendix documetn contains ready-to-use prompts for IDEA -> PROTOTYPE.  These prompts contains established vibe coding patterns. Their detailed explanations can be found in related chapters.  


##  IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - Do not forget to act as a human in the loop. Read each generated documentation and fix any misunderstanding asap. Otherwise they can propagate and cause bigger errors
   - Remind AI keep the core documents and smoke tests to upto date after any change. 
   - Understand the flow so you can intervene. Create as many as free style documents. 
   - It is okay that your understanding of the project will change and you may feel like starting over especially with documentations. Do it. But instead of deleting old devdocs folder just rename it to deprecated. You may refer to them later. 
   - Dont forget to git push your code. AI is not almighty and it can mess things up. 


## COMPLETE PHASES AND PROMPTS

### Phase 0: Data Dump


Provide the AI with all project-relevant information. This is essential. Don't rush to over-define your project at this stage - fuzzy, incomplete details are fine. You'll have opportunities to refine and clarify later. During Phase 1, this information will be processed into three structured documents. 

If you have multiple information sources, consolidate them into a data_dump.txt file. Include these four aspects (even if vaguely defined):
  - Project purpose: Your goals from a non-technical perspective
  - Tech stack preferences: Any preferred technologies or frameworks
  - Target platforms: Mobile, web, embedded, etc.
  - Priorities: Relative importance of platforms, features, and objectives




### Phase 1: Foundation Documents

This phase is explained in detailed in chapter_6/01_devdocs_pattern.md and chapter_6/02_root_docs.md



```
Based on the provided project information, I need you to establish the DevDocs pattern foundation.

First, analyze the project requirements and create a clear understanding of what we're building.
Create the following foundation documents:

1. devdocs/project_description.md

   What are we building?
   What problem are we solving
   What are the various scopes of this project?
   Who are the targeted users?


2. devdocs/philosophy.md
   - what is the philosophy of this project? (dont go into technical details)

   
3. devdocs/known_requirements.md
   - Technical requirements
   - Business requirements 
   - User requirements 

Focus on clarity and mutual understanding before any implementation.
```

### Phase 2: Concept Extraction and Clarification

This phase is explained in detail in chapter_6/03_concept_docs.md 

```
Using the foundation documents you just created (project_description.md, philosophy.md, known_requirements.md), 
extract and document the key core concepts (only needed and core ones):

1. Create devdocs/concepts.md
   - List only essential technical concepts
   - Order by importance/dependency
   - Brief one-line description for each

2. For each concept, create detailed clarification in devdocs/concept_clarifications/
   Name files with ordering prefixes (01_[concept].md, 02_[concept].md, etc.)
   
   Each clarification must answer:
    - Clear short explanation what it is and why it matters
    - How this concept helps the overall project
    - How this concept limits the overall project
    - What kind of information this concept needs as input
    - What kind of process this concept should use
    - What kind of information this concept outputs or relays
    - Explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept
    - Explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept


```

### Phase 3: Simplification for MVP

This phase is explained in detail in chapter_6/03_concept_docs.md 

```
I want you to create simplified_concepts.md using concepts.md and the goal is to trim the features but the core ones for each concept so we can still have these concepts but they are more about prototype. 

And make sure you follow these rules during simplification
        - do not oversimplify the concept to the point underlying architecture is oversimplified and does not support the original concept
        - if a concept has a support for multi subconcept, do not binarize it but diminish the number of supported subconcepts by priotizing the most important ones. 

And then for each concept in simplified_concepts.md create me a clarification markdown file
which includes answer to these questions:

 For each concept write
    - clear short explanation what it is and why it matters
    - How this concept helps the overall project
    - How this concept limits the overall project
    - What kind of information this concept needs as input
    - What kind of process this concept should use
    - What kind of information this concept outputs or relays
    - explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept
    - explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept

Put 1_ 2_ 3_ like prefix of each file to order them and make sure priotize the core concepts when you are ordering them. and do this in devdocs/simplified_concept_clarifications/

Critical: The simplification should reduce features, not break architecture and be flexible for future scope expansion
```


### Phase 4: Identifying Modules


We want development to be done in modular way. This ensures project stays in debuggable/testable complexity. 
This step identifies all possible modules. 


```

Review the simplified concepts and identify logical abstractions that can be organized into modules. Focus on creating a modular architecture that will facilitate cleaner, more maintainable development. Ensure the proposed modularity doesn't compromise performance or security requirements. Avoid over-engineering - only modularize major conceptual boundaries. Document your module structure proposal in module_proposal.md

```


### Phase 5: Architecture and Structure


```
Based on the simplified concepts, and module proposal please propose the most suitable architecture for this project. Keep in mind that we'll be developing iteratively, evolving from a simple prototype to more complex versions over time. And our priority is solid foundation whcih can be expanded overtime and not immediate full scope solution. 

Please use the info from module_proposal.md intelligently (you may choose not to create a module if it is not neccesary or overengineered for the MVP logic ) and avoid tightly coupled architecture. 

Key considerations:
- Avoid over-engineering or excessive complexity or explicity at this stage
- The architecture will evolve as we progress, so maintain flexibility
- Focus on high-level concepts that can accommodate the project's core requirements
- Present a design that balances simplicity with extensibility
- Make sure to use proper design patterns in order to keep modularity of codebase(e.g., repository pattern for DB related operations)

```


### Phase 7: Selecting One module and Preparing for implementation


One way to enforce AI to do the development is done in a moduler way is to implement one by one. 

   
```
 
With the project information, architecture overview, and module structure defined, select the first module for implementation.
   Choose a module that:
  1. Encapsulates the most messy distractive existing code
  2. Is peripheral to the core system (minimal dependencies)
  3. Has stable requirements unlikely to change
  4. Can be implemented independently without requiring other modules to be fully defined first


  And then create [module_name]_module_implementation_proposal.md which explain in order 
  
  1.  what components this modules would have?
  2.  what the interface/endpoints this module would show
  3.  how it would be used with pseudo code
  4.  how it will be used by other/core modules (in a high level without definitive definition)
```



### Phase 8: Module implementation

 ```

 Please implement this module with required files. Based on our previous discussions and documentation, 
please provide:

- Complete file list with their respective directory paths
- Full implementation for each file
- All necessary code to make this module functional

 ```



### Phase 9: Smoke test

Details are explained in chapter_7/smoke_tests_pattern.md

```
Let's design comprehensive smoke tests to validate our implementation. 
Please create smoke_tests folder if it doesnt exists. and Please create a test plan with the following structure:

1. 5 test files, each containing 5 focused test cases
2. File naming convention: test_01_[test_focus_area].py, test_02_[next_focus_area].py, etc.
3. Make sure these tests 
      -  Individual functions/methods in isolation 
      -  Test how components work together
      -  Verify solidly defined requirements are met or not
      
4. For each test file, provide:
  - Clear description of what aspect it tests
  - Why this testing area is critical
  - Brief outline of each test case within the file
5. these tests shouldnt use any testing frameworks. Make the outputs verbose enough so you can see what exactly does not work. 
6. Start with initialization test file. 
7. Each test file's top comment should include how to run it manually. 
```


### Phase 10: Running the smoke test and fix the errors

It is important to run smoke tests by ourself. First we will let AI do this and then we should run them by ourselves. 

```
Lets run each smoke test one by one and fix all errors. If you find errors and cant fix them after 3 changes break down the smoke test into a smaller more isolated forms with more verbose outputs ( in smoke tests files) And rerun them. 

```



### Phase 11: Fuzzy Module Documentation

Now our module is ready and working we should create documentation about it. 

```
 create comprehensive documentation:

Create devdocs/modules/[module_name]/ containing:

1. what_is_this_for.md
   - Core purpose
   - Why it's a separate module
   - What breaks without it
   - Who depends on it

2. interfaces_and_endpoints.md
   - Public methods/functions
   - API endpoints
   - Event emissions
   - Data structures

3. integration_points.md
   - How to integrate this module (only if what to integrate is already defined in the codebase)
   - Multiple integration approaches if flexible
   - Best practices for usage

4. integration_requirements.md
   - Environment variables needed (only if really needed)
   - Database schemas required (only if really needed)
   - External services (only if really needed)
   - Configuration files (only if really needed)

5. limitations.md
   - Performance boundaries
   - Feature boundaries
   - Technical constraints
   - Security limitations

6. possible_use_cases.md
   - Common usage patterns
   - Anti-patterns to avoid
   - Performance tips

7. edge_cases_covered.md
   - Handled edge cases
   - Error scenarios
   - Recovery mechanisms

8. example_usage.md
   - Code examples
   - Setup instructions
   - Common operations
   - Testing approach

9. summary.md
   - Quick reference
   - Main interfaces
   - Critical limitations
   - Integration checklist
```





### Phase 12: Development Support Documents

```
Create supporting documentation for development:

1. devdocs/decisions.md
   - Log architectural decisions as you make them
   - Format: Date, Decision, Reasoning, Trade-offs

5. Create devdocs/issues/ structure:
   - issues/solved/ - for resolved problems
   - issues/unsolved/ - for known issues
   - issues/relevant_to_future/ - for future considerations
```



### Phase 13: INTEGRATION & SMOKE TESTS

```

```
